# Stock-Market-Data
Hi folks,

Here is a collection of data I have scraped or aggregated for most of the stocks in the S&P 500, including popular ones like Apple (AAPL).

It has the following data:
- Daily news articles and sentiments on those articles collected over the last few years. (~300k articles)
- All quarterly stock fundamentals (ratios) for 10-20 years.
- Stock price data (daily close) over the last 10-20 years.

Use it however you please for PERSONAL use. If you do leverage it to make some money, just remember me and thank me in your head :)
